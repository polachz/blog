![Me](./photo.jpg#width=145px;height=186px;float=left;margin=0px;margin-right=15px) Hi there. I’m a developer and software architect with more than 30 years of experience in the business. My first computer was the Atari 800XL, where I have collected my first programming skills in the assembler language because all other languages have been unusable for large projects on this platform.

After that I have moved on the PC, where I have experience with Windows and Linux system administration and programming.

In the last decades I’m focusing on network security, Windows networking system and Windows Network Drivers development.

In the past I worked for the AVG, well known antivirus company, where I led design and development of the AVG Firewall component. 

Then I have moved to the [Avast](https://avast.com) – a company developing the popular AVAST! antivirus solution. Here I’m responsible for the on the fly network traffic WFP based driver filtering solutions.

If you can contact me, please use the [contact](/contact) page.
Some of my projects are hosted on the [GiHub](https://github.com/polachz). Maybe you can find here something useful.

To verify integrity of my important files or to send me an encrypted message, please use this [PGP key](/pgp_public_key.asc):
- ID: **4C568D6E**
- Fingerprint: **AD95 C2CB C31B A1DE 01CF 8023 91B1 D978 4C56 8D6E**

You can also obtain the key from one of these PGP Key Servers: 
- [GnuPG KS](http://keys.gnupg.net/)
- [Ubuntu KS](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/)

Do not forget to prepend the 0x hex prefix before short ID if you use the ID instead of my name for lookup :smirk:
